* cancel all ( all | ask | bid )

(01:08) <       c_k> the one feature that would be nice for me is the ability to cancel all orders
(01:08) <       c_k> instead of having to read the list of open orders and cancel them individually
(01:16) <       c_k> like "cancel ask *" I guess
(01:16) <       c_k> anyway, very cool :)

* better depth display (  column, colors, rounding )
